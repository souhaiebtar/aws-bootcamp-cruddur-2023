# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Install aws cli

as  i'm working on Linux ( ubuntu more exactly ), i did use the snippet in the Linux instruction to install aws cli on my machine, of the page [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), there was also the possibility to install it using Homebrew (yes, now it does also support linux ) using `brew install awscli` but i did prefer the official way.
